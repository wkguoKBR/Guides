# Deploying MATLAB Microservice Docker Image to Choreo (Wednesday, July 17 2024)

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through how to create a microservice Docker image of a MATLAB function using MATLAB Compiler SDK, deploying it to Choreo as a service, and then exposing it as an API. We'll be making use of a variety of existing resources/documentation throughout this guide, which will all be compiled into a list at the bottom for future reference or more details.

## Instructions

### Step 1. Create Microservice Docker Image in MATLAB

#### Requirements
> - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [MATLAB Compiler](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler.html), and [MATLAB Compiler SDK](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-compiler-sdk.html)
> 
> - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
> 
> - [WSL2 - Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YByZ_sOOWsQ)

1) **Create MATLAB Function**
   
   Identify the MATLAB function you are interested in packaging. For the purposes of the rest of the guide, we will use the function `simplebondprice.m` with the following code:
   ```
   function price = simplebondprice(face_value, coupon_payment, interest_rate, num_payments)
    M = face_value;
    C = coupon_payment;
    N = num_payments;
    i = interest_rate;

    price = C * ( (1 - (1 + i)^-N) / i) + M * (1 + i)^-N;
   end
   ```
   We can try out the function using the MATLAB Command Prompt. Enter `simplebondprice(100000,4.5,3.2,36)`
   ```
   >> simplebondprice(100000,4.5,3.2,36)

   ans =
       1.4062
   ```
   
2) **Package Function as into a Deployable Code Archive**

   The next step is to package `simplebondprice` into a code archive with the `compiler.build.productionServerArchive` function.

   ```
   >> mservice = compiler.build.productionServerArchive('simplebondprice.m','ArchiveName','bondtools','Verbose','on')

   mservice = 
       Results with properties:
                        BuildType: 'productionServerArchive'
                            Files: {'C:\Users\K160458\Documents\bondtoolsproductionServerArchive\bondtools.ctf'}
          IncludedSupportPackages: {}
                          Options: [1Ã—1 compiler.build.ProductionServerArchiveOptions]
   ```

   When fully built, you should see the folder `bondtoolsproductionServerArchive` in your current working directory which holds the deployable archive.
   
3) **Build the Docker Image**

   We can construct our microservice Docker image with the `mservice` object and function `compiler.package.microserviceDockerImage`. You will want Docker Desktop to be up and running before submitting the command. Furthermore, please note that your first time building a Docker image with this function will take a couple of minutes.

   ```
   >> compiler.package.microserviceDockerImage(mservice,'ImageName','bondtools')
   Creating Dockerfile for image 'matlabruntimebase/r2024a/release/update4' at 'C:\Users\K160458\Documents\bondtoolsmicroserviceDockerImage\matlabruntimebase\Dockerfile.deps'.
   .
   .
   .
   For help getting started with microservice images, please read:

   C:\Users\K160458\Documents\bondtoolsmicroserviceDockerImage\GettingStarted.txt
   ```

   Once finished, you should have access to a helpful `GettingStarted.txt` that'll provide information on how to run the microservice image and use the curl command to make an HTTP request.
   
4) **Test the Microservice**

   Verify that you possess the `bondtools` image in your Linux (ex. Ubuntu) terminal.
   
   ```
   docker images
   ```

   ![bondtools_dockerImages](Images/images_matlab_docker/docker_images_bondtools.png)

   Run the microservice image in Docker on port 9900.

   ```
   docker run --rm -td -p 9900:9910 bondtools -l trace
   ```

   ![Run Docker Image](Images/images_matlab_docker/run_docker_image.png)

   Now that our service is running, let's test it using the `curl` command to send a JSON request body with input arguments [100000,4.5,3.2,36] to the service through port 9900.

   ```
   curl -v -H Content-Type:application/json -d '{"nargout":1,"rhs":[100000,4.5,3.2,36]}' \
   "http://localhost:9900/bondtools/simplebondprice"; echo
   ```

   ![Curl Command](Images/images_matlab_docker/curl_command.png)

   You can also use external tools such as Postman to send in requests if you prefer.

### Step 2. Deploy Microservice to Choreo

1) **Save Docker Image into GitHub Repository**

   To continue deploy our microservice from *Step 1. Create Microservice Docker Image in MATLAB*, we first compile it into a (preferably public) GitHub repository. Access the example repo [MATLAB-Choreo-Test](https://github.com/wkguoKBR/MATLAB-Choreo-Test) to ensure yours is ultimately setup similarly if not the same.

   For starters, create a new repository and orient it like so:

2) **Update Dockerfile in Microservice Docker Image Folder**

   Navigate to the folder with your microservice Docker image, which in this case is `bondtoolsmicroserviceDockerImage`. Here, you should see a combination of 5 different files/folders.
   - `applicationFilesForMATLABCompiler`: Contains *bondtools.ctf*, which is the code archive and contains our MATLAB code
   - `matlabruntime`: Contains *Dockerfile.runtime* which runs a MATLAB Runtime image using Docker, allowing the execution of MATLAB applications without the need to have MATLAB installed
   - `matlabruntimebase`: Contains *Dockerfile.deps* which handles the dependencies and essential files required to setup the MATLAB Runtime environment
   - `Dockerfile`: Creates a Docker image named `bondtools` that holds our compiled MATLAB application
   - `GettingStarted.txt`: Provides a simple introduction on how to use the `bondtoolsmicroserviceDockerImage` and run the microservice

   ![GitHub Initial](Images/images_matlab_docker/github_initial.png)
  
   Open the `Dockerfile` and observe Line 6: `FROM matlabruntime/r2024a/release/update4/108000000000000000`. This line is responsible for specifying the base image for the Docker image, using a specific version of the MATLAB Runtime environment. When you run `Dockerfile`, this base image is actually built ahead-of-time by first running `Dockerfile.deps` and then `Dockerfile.runtime*. In a local environment, this allows for the usage of a minimal MATLAB Runtime package to assist in compiling and executing our MATLAB applications.

   ![Dockerfile](Images/images_matlab_docker/Dockerfile.png)

   However, when our microservice is deployed to Choreo at its current state, we'll encounter an error at Line 6 during runtime because it doesn't recognize our base image of `matlabruntime/r2024a/release/update4/108000000000000000`. This is due to the fact that the base image is not first built by running `Dockerfile.deps` and `Dockerfile.runtime` ahead of `Dockerfile`.

   A solution to this problem is to use an image publicly accessible on Docker Hub that contains the MATLAB Runtime. There are two ways:
   1) Use an existing image such as [wkguo/matlabruntime:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/wkguo/matlabruntime)
   2) Create and push your own MATLAB Runtime image onto Docker Hub

   If you choose Option 1, you need to make three changes to `Dockerfile`:
   1) Line 6 to `FROM wkguo/matlabruntime:latest`
   2) Line 12 to `USER 10001` (Note: In Choreo, a valid USER ID is between [10000-20000](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-a-containerized-application/))
   3) Line 14 such that the MATLAB Runtime version matches that of what `wkguo/matlabruntime:latest` possesses, which is `R2024a`.
   <br></br>
   ```
   6       FROM wkguo/matlabruntime:latest
   .
   .
   .
   12      USER 10001
   .  
   14      ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/matlabruntime/R2024a/bin/glnxa64/muserve", "-a", "/usr/bin/mlrtapp/bondtools.ctf"]`
   ```

   Here is what your base `Dockerfile` should look like:

   ![Final Dockerfile](Images/images_matlab_docker/final_dockerfile.png)

   
3) **Add in .choreo/endpoints.yaml and openapi.yaml**

### Step 3. Expose Choreo Service as an API
