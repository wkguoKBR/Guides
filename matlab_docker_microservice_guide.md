# Deploying MATLAB Microservice Docker Image to Choreo (Wednesday, July 17 2024)

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through how to create a microservice Docker image of a MATLAB function using MATLAB Compiler SDK, deploying it to Choreo as a service, and then exposing it as an API. We'll be making use of a variety of existing resources/documentation throughout this guide, which will all be compiled into a list at the bottom for future reference or more details.

## Instructions

### Step 1. Create Microservice Docker Image in MATLAB

#### Requirements
> - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [MATLAB Compiler](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler.html), and [MATLAB Compiler SDK](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-compiler-sdk.html)
> 
> - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
> 
> - [WSL2 - Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YByZ_sOOWsQ)

1) **Create MATLAB Function**
   
   Identify the MATLAB function you are interested in packaging. For the purposes of the rest of the guide, we will use the function `simplebondprice.m` with the following code:
   ```
   function price = simplebondprice(face_value, coupon_payment, interest_rate, num_payments)
    M = face_value;
    C = coupon_payment;
    N = num_payments;
    i = interest_rate;

    price = C * ( (1 - (1 + i)^-N) / i) + M * (1 + i)^-N;
   end
   ```
   We can try out the function using the MATLAB Command Prompt. Enter `simplebondprice(100000,4.5,3.2,36)`
   ```
   >> simplebondprice(100000,4.5,3.2,36)

   ans =
       1.4062
   ```
   
2) **Package Function as into a Deployable Code Archive**

   The next step is to package `simplebondprice` into a code archive with the `compiler.build.productionServerArchive` function.

   ```
   >> mservice = compiler.build.productionServerArchive('simplebondprice.m','ArchiveName','bondtools','Verbose','on')

   mservice = 
       Results with properties:
                        BuildType: 'productionServerArchive'
                            Files: {'C:\Users\K160458\Documents\bondtoolsproductionServerArchive\bondtools.ctf'}
          IncludedSupportPackages: {}
                          Options: [1Ã—1 compiler.build.ProductionServerArchiveOptions]
   ```

   When fully built, you should see the folder `bondtoolsproductionServerArchive` in your current working directory which holds the deployable archive.
   
3) **Build the Docker Image**

   We can construct our microservice Docker image with the `mservice` object and function `compiler.package.microserviceDockerImage`. You will want Docker Desktop to be up and running before submitting the command. Furthermore, please note that your first time building a Docker image with this function will take a couple of minutes.

   ```
   >> compiler.package.microserviceDockerImage(mservice,'ImageName','bondtools')
   Creating Dockerfile for image 'matlabruntimebase/r2024a/release/update4' at 'C:\Users\K160458\Documents\bondtoolsmicroserviceDockerImage\matlabruntimebase\Dockerfile.deps'.

   For help getting started with microservice images, please read:

   C:\Users\K160458\Documents\bondtoolsmicroserviceDockerImage\GettingStarted.txt
   ```

   Once finished, you should have access to a helpful `GettingStarted.txt` that'll provide information on how to run the microservice image and use the curl command to make an HTTP request.
   
4) **Test the Microservice**

   Verify that you possess the `bondtools` image in your Linux (ex. Ubuntu) terminal.
   
   ```
   docker images
   ```
   
8) **Save Docker Image into GitHub Repository**

This section is based on official documentation [Create Microservice Docker Image](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/mps_dev_test/create-a-microservice-docker-image.html?searchHighlight=docker&s_tid=srchtitle_docker_5).

### Step 2. Deploy Microservice to Choreo

### Step 3. Expose Choreo Service as an API
